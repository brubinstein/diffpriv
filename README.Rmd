## Overview

The `diffpriv` package makes privacy-aware data science in R easy. 
`diffpriv` implements the formal framework of differential privacy:
differentially-private mechanisms can safely release to untrusted third parties:
statistics computed, models fit, or arbitrary structures derived on 
privacy-sensitive data. Due to the worst-case nature of the framework, mechanism
development typically requires involved theoretical analysis. `diffpriv` offers 
a turn-key approach to differential privacy by automating this process with
sensitivity sampling in place of theoretical sensitivity analysis.

## Installation

Obtaining `diffpriv` is easy. From within R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
##  Install the development version of diffpriv from GitHub:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brubinstein/diffpriv")
```

## Example

A typical example in differential privacy is privately releasing a simple 
`target` function of privacy-sensitive input data `X`. Say the mean of 
`numeric` data:

```{r example-1}
## a target function we'd like to run on private data X, releasing the result
target <- function(X) mean(X)
```

First load the `diffpriv` package (installed as above) and construct a 
chosen differentially-private mechanism for privatizing `target`.

```{r example-2}
## target seeks to release a numeric, so we'll use the Laplace mechanism---a
## standard generic mechanism for privatizing numeric responses
library(diffpriv)
mech <- DPMechLaplace(target = target)
```

To run `mech` on a dataset `X` we must first determine the sensitivity of
`target` to small changes to input dataset. One avenue is to analytically bound
sensitivity (on paper; see the [vignette](inst/doc/diffpriv.pdf)) and supply it
via the `sensitivity` argument of mechanism construction: in this case not hard
if we assume bounded data, but in general sensitivity can be very non-trivial 
to calculate manually. The other approach, which we follow in this example, is
sensitivity sampling: repeated probing of `target` to estimate sensitivity 
automatically. We need only specify a distribution for generating random probe
datasets; `sensitivitySampler()` takes care of the rest. The price we pay for 
this convenience is the weaker form of random differential privacy.

```{r example-3}
## set a dataset sampling distribution, then estimate target sensitivity with
## sufficient samples for subsequent mechanism responses to achieve random
## differential privacy with confidence 1-gamma
distr <- function(n) rnorm(n)
mech <- sensitivitySampler(mech, oracle = distr, n = 5, gamma = 0.1)
mech@sensitivity    ## DPMech and subclasses are S4: slots accessed via @
```

With a sensitivity-calibrated mechanism in hand, we can release private 
responses on a dataset `X`, displayed alongside the non-private response 
for comparison:

```{r example-4}
X <- c(0.328,-1.444,-0.511,0.154,-2.062) # length is sensitivitySampler() n
r <- releaseResponse(mech, privacyParams = DPParamsEps(epsilon = 1), X = X)
cat("Private response r$response:   ", r$response,
  "\nNon-private response target(X):", target(X))
```

## Getting Started

The above example demonstrates the main components of `diffpriv`:

* Virtual class `DPMech` for generic mechanisms that captures the non-private
  `target` and releases privatized responses from it. Current subclasses
    + `DPMechLaplace`, `DPMechGaussian`: the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms 
      for releasing numeric responses with additive noise;
    + `DPMechExponential`: the exponential mechanism for privately 
      optimizing over finite sets (which need not be numeric); and
    + `DPMechBernstein`: the Bernstein mechanism for privately releasing 
      multivariate real-valued functions.
* Class `DPParamsEps` and subclasses for encapsulating privacy parameters.
* `sensitivitySampler()` method of `DPMech` subclasses estimates target 
  sensitivity necessary to run `releaseResponse()` of `DPMech` generic 
  mechanisms. This provides an easy alternative to exact sensitivity bounds
  requiring mathematical analysis. The sampler repeatedly probes 
  `DPMech@target` to estimate sensitivity to data perturbation. Running 
  mechanisms with obtained sensitivities yield random differential privacy.
